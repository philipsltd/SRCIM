# SRCIM

Project developed for NOVA SST as part of the subject SRCIM. 
The most updated version of LAB 1, which consisted in the setup of the station itself is on the branch 1.

The final version of LAB 2, where we updated the plant to work in the most power efficient way, using machine learning models is on the branch 2.

To run the project I used the Coppelia Environment and I compiled the Java code using the IntelliJ IDEA. When ran, a small window pops up with different products to send to the station, and everything else is done automaticaly.
