Project developed for NOVA SST as part of the subject SRCIM. 
The most updated version of LAB 1, which consisted in the setup of the station itself is on the branch 1.

The final version of LAB 2, where we updated the plant to work in the most power efficient way, using machine learning models is on the branch 2.
